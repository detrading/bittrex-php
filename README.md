### It is recommended that you read the official document first

Bittrex docs [https://docs.bitfinex.com/](https://docs.bitfinex.com/)

V1.1 not supported

V3 support

All interface methods are initialized the same as those provided by Bittrex. See details [src/api](https://github.com/zhouaini528/bittrex-php/tree/master/src/Api)

Most of the interface is now complete, and the user can continue to extend it based on my design, working with me to improve it.
